0.Make the spreadsheet good:
  I.MACRO:
Sub DeleteColumnsWithKeywords()
    Dim ws As Worksheet
    Dim col As Integer
    Dim lastCol As Integer
    Dim keywords As Variant
    Dim cellValue As String
    Dim keywordFound As Boolean
    Dim i As Integer
    
    ' Define the worksheet you want to work with
    Set ws = ActiveSheet
    
    ' Define the keywords to search for
    keywords = Array("Male", "Female", "Estimate", "Margin")
    
    ' Find the last column with data in the second row
    lastCol = ws.Cells(2, ws.Columns.Count).End(xlToLeft).Column
    
    ' Loop through columns from right to left to avoid shifting issues
    For col = lastCol To 1 Step -1
        cellValue = ws.Cells(2, col).Value
        keywordFound = False
        
        ' Check if the cell in the second row contains any of the keywords
        For i = LBound(keywords) To UBound(keywords)
            If InStr(1, cellValue, keywords(i), vbTextCompare) > 0 Then
                keywordFound = True
                Exit For
            End If
        Next i
        
        ' If any keyword is found, delete the column
        If keywordFound Then
            ws.Columns(col).Delete
        End If
    Next col
End Sub
  II. Delete useless categories(keep only Black, White, Asian, Hawaiian (just for Hawaii))
      (maybe we should distinguish Indian, Chinese, arab)
1.get mean age after having the good spreadsheet:
=SUM(D2*2.5,E2*7,F2*12,G2*17,H2*22,I2*30,J2*40,K2*50,L2*57,M2*62,N2*70,O2*80)/100
2.Delete columns with just total population estimate
3. Check: It should be until column W (if you have deleted the first column with the state codes etc)
   Headers: 
Geographic Area Name,	Mean AGE, 	Percent AGE Under 5 years,	Percent AGE 5 to 9 years,	Percent AGE 10 to 14, years,	Percent AGE 15 to 19 years,	Percent AGE 20 to 24 years,	Percent AGE 25 to 34 years,	Percent AGE 35 to 44, years,	Percent AGE 45 to 54 years,	Percent AGE 55 to 59 years,	Percent AGE 60 to 64 years,	Percent AGE 65 to 74, years,	Percent AGE 75 to 84 years,	Percent RACE Total population One  RACE, 	Percent RACE Total population Two or more  RACES,	Percent RACE One  RACE, 	Percent RACE One  RACE White,	Percent RACE One  RACE Black or African American,	Percent RACE One  RACE American Indian and Alaska Native,	Percent RACE One  RACE Asian,	Percent HISPANIC OR LATINO AND  RACE Total population Hispanic or Latino (of any  RACE ),	Percent RACE One  RACE Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander,
